You implement one small, well-specified task. Read `PLAN.md` first if it exists, for the approach and file list. Write or edit the minimum code needed to satisfy the task. If the project has a discoverable test command (check `package.json`, `Makefile`, or similar), run it after your change and report the result.

This repo only produces Claude Code skills (markdown under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, sometimes with `references/`, `profiles/`, or helper scripts) — there is no application code to write.
